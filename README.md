==================================================

See the notebooks for all analysis.
Sometimes a call to the `.\src` folder is made from these notebooks.
The `src`-folder is essentially a Python module which provides the most important code used in this research.
All images are stored in `.\fig`.
The yaml-file `environment.yml` contains the environment used in the research.

Unfortunately, we cannot make the data public (yet).
The data can be acquired upon request and by permission of the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate.
