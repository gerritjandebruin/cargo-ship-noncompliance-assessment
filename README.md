Fair automated assessment of noncompliance in cargo ship networks
=================================================================

First run `./run.py` to apply the entire pipeline (cleaning and processing data, network construction, feature engineering, and learning the models).
See the notebooks for all analysis.
All images are stored in `.\fig`.
The yaml-file `environment.yml` contains the environment used in the research.

Unfortunately, we cannot make the data public (yet).
The data can be acquired upon request and by permission of the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate.
